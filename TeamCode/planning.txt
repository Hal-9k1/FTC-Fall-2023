Competition robot!
  - AUTONOMOUS PERIOD (no human control)
    - Move around
    - Computer vision for orientation
    - Computer vision to know what to do
      - Adjust path on the fly (intelligent Roomba)
    - Know where it is so it knows where to go
  - TELEOP PERIOD (human controlled)
    - Use all the features of the robot
      - Arm (hand, joints)
      - Wheels

Systems:
  - Omnidirectional drive (drive in any direction, turn)
  - Arm control
  - Navigator/spidersense (keep track of expected position and update with sensor inputs)
  - Path planner/Google Maps (use sensor input to plan where to go, maybe recover from collisions)
    - Piece management (did we actually pick up that pixel? use weight sense from arm encoder or vision)


Questions:
  - Can you move the spike around?
  - Can you use a motor as a weight sensor?

Notes:
  - A multi-jointed arm could better flick the paper airplane
